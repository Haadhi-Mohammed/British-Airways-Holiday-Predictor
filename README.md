# British-Airways-Holiday-Predictor
Developed a machine learning model that identifies 77% of potential holiday package buyers using airline booking data. I implemented feature engineering and imbalance handling techniques to enable proactive sales campaigns, which are projected to generate substantial incremental revenue.

## Business Impact
- 77% buyer identification rate (from 11% baseline)
- substantial projected annual revenue lift

## Key Features
- Feature engineering: `last_minute_bookings`, `premium_requests`
- SMOTE for class imbalance handling
- XGBoost with threshold optimization
